# NN_MINIST
1. Implement fully connected neural network model to classify MNIST images
2. For each class, visualize the 10 images that are mis-classified with the highest score.
3. Reduce the number of training data to 1 example per class (chosen randomly from training data)
and plot the curve.
4. Try different mini-batch sizes (1, 10, 100) for the original case and plot the results.
5. Sort the data before training.
6. Add a hidden layer with hidden neurons and ReLU activation function.
